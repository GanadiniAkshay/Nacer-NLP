14.5. Summary
Although the situation has improved considerably, browsers unfortunately aren’t bug-free and usually don’t support web standards consistently.
When writing JavaScript applications, choosing which browsers and platforms to support is an important consideration.
Because it’s not possible to support all combinations, quality should never be sacrificed for coverage!
The biggest challenges to writing JavaScript code that can be executed in various browsers are bug fixes, regressions, browser bugs, missing features, and external code.
Reusable cross-browser development involves juggling several factors:
Code size— Keeping the file size small
Performance overhead— Keeping the performance level above a palatable minimum
API quality— Making sure that the APIs work uniformly across browsers
There’s no magic formula for determining the correct balance of these factors.
The development factors are something that have to be balanced by every developer in their individual development efforts.
By using smart techniques such as feature detection, we can defend against the numerous directions from which reusable code will be attacked without making any undue sacrifices.
