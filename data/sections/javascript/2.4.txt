2.4. Summary
The HTML code received by the browser is used as a blueprint for creating the DOM, an internal representation of the structure of a client-side web application.
We use JavaScript code to dynamically modify the DOM to bring dynamic behavior to web applications.
The execution of client-side web applications is performed in two phases:
Page building— HTML code is processed to create the DOM, and global JavaScript code is executed when script nodes are encountered. During this execution, the JavaScript code can modify the current DOM to any degree and can even register event handlers—functions that are executed when a particular event occurs (for example, a mouse click or a keyboard press). Registering event handlers is easy: Use the built-in addEventListener method.
Event handling— Various events are processed one at a time, in the order in which they were generated. The event-handling phase relies heavily on the event queue, in which all events are stored in the order in which they occurred. The event loop always checks the top of the queue for events, and if an event is found, the matching event-handler function is invoked.
