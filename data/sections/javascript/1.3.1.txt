1.3.1. Debugging
Debugging JavaScript used to mean using alert to verify the value of variables. Fortunately, the ability to debug JavaScript code has dramatically improved, in no small part because of the popularity of the Firebug developer extension for Firefox. Similar tools have been developed for all major browsers:
Firebug— The popular developer extension for Firefox that got the ball rolling (http://getfirebug.com/)
Chrome DevTools— Developed by the Chrome team and used in Chrome and Opera
Firefox Developer Tools— A tool included in Firefox, built by the Firefox team
F12 Developer Tools— Included in Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge
WebKit Inspector— Used by Safari
As you can see, every major browser offers developer tools that we can use to debug our web applications. The days of using JavaScript alerts for debugging are long gone!
All of these tools are based on similar ideas, which were mostly introduced by Firebug, so they offer similar functionality: exploring the DOM, debugging JavaScript, editing CSS styles, tracking network events, and so on. Any of them will do a fine job; use the one offered by your browser of choice, or in the browser in which you’re investigating bugs.
In addition, you can use some of them, such as Chrome Dev Tools, to debug other kinds of applications, like Node.js apps. (We’ll introduce you to some debugging techniques in appendix B.)
