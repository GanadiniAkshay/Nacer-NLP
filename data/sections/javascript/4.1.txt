4.1. Using implicit function parameters
In the preceding chapter, we explored the differences between function parameters (variables listed as part of a function definition) and function arguments (values passed to the function when we invoke it). But we didn’t mention that in addition to the parameters that we’ve explicitly stated in the function definition, function invocations are usually passed two implicit parameters: arguments and this.
By implicit, we mean that these parameters aren’t explicitly listed in the function signature, but are silently passed to the function and accessible within the function. They can be referenced within the function just like any other explicitly named parameter. Let’s take a look at each of these implicit parameters in turn.
