So we've just looked at a simple example of routing. Conceptually, it's not too crazy: it maps an HTTP verb + URI combo to a request handler. This lets you map things like GET /about or POST /new/sword to a specific bit of code. This is great!

But we're greedy. If Express were a vat of ice cream, we wouldn't be satisfied with one scoop. We want more scoops. We want sprinkles. We want chocolate sauce. We want more routing features.

NOTE Some other frameworks (Ruby on Rails, for example) have a centralized routing file where all routes are defined in one place. Express is not this wayâ€”they can be defined in a lot of places.
