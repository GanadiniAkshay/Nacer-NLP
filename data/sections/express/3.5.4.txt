Look at that! What a beautiful little guestbook. It reminds me of the 1990s.


Let's review the different parts of this little project:


·   We use a middleware function to log all requests, which helps us do debugging. We also use a middleware at the end to serve the 404 page.


·   We use Express's routing to direct users to the homepage, the "add a new entry" view, and the POST for adding a new entry.


·   We use Express and EJS to render pages. It lets us dynamically create HTML; we use this to dynamically display the content.


3.6    Summary


In this chapter you saw that:


·   Express is a library that sits on top of Node and abstracts away a lot of that complexity


·   Express has four main features:


-   Middleware for letting a request flow through multiple headers


-   Routing for handling a request at a specific spot


-   Convenience methods and properties


-   Views for dynamically rendering HTML


·   Many templating engines have been ported to work with Express. The default one is called EJS.
