Jade has another cool feature called mixins. Mixins are basically functions that you define in your Jade file to cut down on repetitive tasks.

Let's re-implement the users widget example from the EJS section. We'll make a widget that's given an object called user and returns an HTML widget for that user. Here's we might do that:

Listing 7.19 A user widget mixin

This would render the user widget for the currentUser and for every other user in the userList. No duplicated code for us!

That's all that we'll look at with Jade. For more about Jade's syntax, you can look at Jade's reference documentation at http://jade-lang.com/reference/.
