I've got some bad news: your server is might crash at some point.

There are loads of things that can crash your servers. Perhaps there's a bug in your code and you're referencing an undefined variable; perhaps a hacker has found a way to crash your server with malicious input; perhaps your servers have reached their capacities. Unfortunately, these apps can get wildly complicated, and at some point, they might crash.

And while this chapter has tips to help keep your apps running smoothly, you don't want a crash to completely ruin your day. While they're not ideal, you can recover from them.

The folks at Nodejitsu developed a simple tool called Forever. Its name might be a hint: it keeps your apps running forever. The important part: if your app crashes, Forever will restart it.

To install Forever, just run npm install forever --save. You've probably had an npm start script in your package.json for awhile, and we're going to change it from this:

Listing 10.18  A classic npm start script

…to this:

Listing 10.19  npm start with Forever

And now your server will restart if it crashes!

NOTE You can see a simple code example of this in action at the book's source code repository at https://github.com/EvanHahn/Express.js-in-Action-code/tree/master /Chapter_09/forever-example.
