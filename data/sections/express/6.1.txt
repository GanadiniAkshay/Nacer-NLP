Let's talk about a simple JSON API and how it could be used so that we see a concrete example of the kind of thing we'll be building.

Let's imagine a simple API that takes a timezone string like "America/Los_Angeles" or "Europe/London" and returns a string that represents the current time in that timezone (like "2015-04-07T20:09:58-07:00"). Notice that these strings aren't things that a human would naturally type or be able to easily readâ€”they're for a computer to understand.

Our API might accept an HTTP request to this URL:

And our API server might respond with JSON, like this:

One could imagine writing simple applications that used this API. These applications could run on a variety of platforms, and as long as they communicated with this API and could parse JSON (which most platforms can), they can build whatever they want!

You could build a simple webpage that consumed this API, as shown in Figure 6.1. It might send AJAX requests to your server, parse the JSON, and display it in the HTML.

You could also build a mobile application, like Figure 6.2. It would make a request to our API server, parse the JSON, and display the results on the screen.

You could even build a command-line tool that runs in the terminal, like in Figure 6.3. Once again, it'd make a request to the API server, parse the JSON, and display the results for humans in the terminal.

The point is this: if you make an API that takes requests from computers and spits out responses for computers (not humans!), you can build user interfaces atop that API.
