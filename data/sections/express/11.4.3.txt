connect-assets provides two major helper functions to your views: js and css. js("myfile") will generate a <script> tag that corresponds to myfile. The css helper will do the same but for CSS, with a <link> tag. They return the HTML to include the most recent version of your assets, which means that they'll append a long hash to the name to make sure your browser doesn't use old cached assets.

If you're using Jade to render your views, you'll reference them from your views like this:

If you're using EJS instead, it's pretty similar. You reference connect-assets's helpers from your views like this:

If you're using another view engine, you'll need to make sure you aren't escaping HTML when you do this, because these helpers are spitting out raw HTML tags that shouldn't be escaped.

In any case, these will spit out something like this:

And your assets will be loaded!
