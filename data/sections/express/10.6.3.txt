Adobe products like Flash Player and Reader can make cross-origin web requests. As a result, a Flash file could make requests to your server. If another website serves a malicious Flash file, users of that site could make arbitrary requests to your Express application (likely unknowingly). This could cause them to hammer your server with requests or to load resources you don’t intend them to.

This is easily prevented by adding a file at the root of your site called crossdomain.xml.  When an Adobe product is going to load a file off of your domain, it will first check the crossdomain.xml file to make sure your domain allows it. As the administrator, you can define this XML file to keep certain Flash users in or out of your site. It’s likely, however, that you don’t want any Flash users on your page. In that case, make sure you’re serving this XML content at the root of your site (at /crossdomain.xml):

This prevents any Flash users from loading content off of your site, unless they come from your domain. If you’re interested in changing this policy, take a look at the spec at https://www.adobe.com/devnet/articles/crossdomain_policy_file_spec.html.

This file can be served up in a few ways. If you’re using Helmet from before, you can simply add a middleware and be done:

Alternatively, if you're serving static files (which you likely are), you can place that restrictive crossdomain.xml file into your static file directory.
