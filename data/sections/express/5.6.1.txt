For this application, we'll use four Node packages: Express (obviously), Reckon (for grabbing weather data), Zippity-do-dah (for turning ZIP codes into latitude/longitude), and EJS (for rendering HTML views). (These are some pretty good names, right? Especially "zippity-do-dah".)

Make a new Express application. You'll want to make sure the package.json looks something like this when it's time to start:

Listing 5.19 package.json for this application

Make sure you have all of these dependencies installed by running npm install in your application's directory.

On the client, we'll depend on jQuery and a minimal CSS framework called Pure (more information at http://purecss.io/). It's likely that you already know about jQuery, but Pure is a bit more obscure (though most everything is more obscure than jQuery). Pure gives us a little bit of styling for text and forms, similar to Twitter's Bootstrap. The difference with Pure is that it's far lighter-weight, which better suits this kind of application.

Make two directories: one called public and one called views.

We're ready to get started!
