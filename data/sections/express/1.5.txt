Every introduction to a new code thing needs a “hello world”, right?

Let's take a look at one of the simplest Express applications we can build: the Hello World. We'll delve into this in much greater detail throughout the book, so don't worry if not all of this makes sense right now.

Here's Hello World, in Express:

Listing 1.1 “Hello World” in Express

#A Require Express and put it in a variable.

#B Call express() to make a new Express application, and put it inside of a variable called “app”.

#C When someone sends a request to the root of your site (at “/”), they will be sent “Hello world!”.

#D Start the Express server on port 3000 and log that the server has started.

Once again: if not all of this makes sense to you, don't worry! But you might be able to see that we're creating an Express application, defining a route that responds with “Hello world!”, and starting our app on port 3000.

We'll learn all of Express's secrets soon.
