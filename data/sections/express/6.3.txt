There's a common application pattern: Create, Read, Update, and Delete. It's shortened to CRUD, which is a fun word.

Lots of applications use CRUD. For example, imagine a photo-sharing app that has no user accounts; anyone can upload photos. Here's how you might envision that in CRUD style:

·   Users can upload photos; this is the create step.

·   Users can browse photos; this is the read part.

·   Users can update photos, perhaps by giving them different filters or changing captions; this would be an update.

·   Users can delete photos from the website. This would be, well, a delete.

You could imagine lots of your favorite applications fitting into this model, from photo sharing to social networks to file storage.

Before we can talk about how CRUD fits into APIs, we need to talk about something called HTTP methods, also known as HTTP verbs.
