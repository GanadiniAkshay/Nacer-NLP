We'll need a library that will let us talk to MongoDB from Node, and therefore from Express. There are a number of lower-level modules, but we'd like something easy-to-use and feature-filled. What should we use?

Look no further than Mongoose (at http://mongoosejs.com/), an officially-supported library for talking to MongoDB from Node.js. To quote its documentation:

Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to modeling your application data and includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box.

In other words, Mongoose gives us much more than simply talking to the database. Let's learn how it works by creating a simple website with user accounts.

Note: Don't forget about Sequelize

If you want to use SQL with Express and you're looking for the "Mongoose of SQL", don't forget about the Sequelize module I mentioned!
