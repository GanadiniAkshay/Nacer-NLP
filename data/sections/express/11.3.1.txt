These instructions will deviate from the official Grunt instructions a bit. The documentation will tell you to install Grunt globally, but I believe that you should install everything locally if you can. This allows you to install multiple versions of Grunt on your system and doesn't pollute your "global" registry.

Every project has a package.json. If you want to add Grunt to a project, you'll want to define a new script so that you can run the local Grunt:

Listing 11.14 A script for running the local Grunt

If you'd like to follow along with these examples, you can make a new project with a barebones package.json like this one:

Listing 11.15 A barebones package.json for these examples

Grunt isn't set up yet, but when it is, this allows us to say npm run grunt to run the local Grunt.

Next, you'll want to npm install grunt --save-dev and npm install grunt-cli --save-dev (or just npm install grunt grunt-cli --save-dev) to save Grunt and its command-line tool as local dependencies.

Next, you'll want to create a something called a "Gruntfile", which Grunt examines to figure out what it should do. The Gruntfile lives at the root of your project (in the same folder as your package.json) and is called Gruntfile.js.

Here's a "hello world" Gruntfile. When you run Grunt, it will look at this Gruntfile, find the appropriate task, and run the code inside.

To try this out, type npm run grunt into your terminal. You should see the following output:

Unfortunately, "hello world" isn't of much use to us. Let's look at some more useful tasks we can define.
