First, you'll need to get a Heroku account. Visit Heroku.com and sign up (if you don't already have an account). The signup process should be fairly straightforward if you've ever signed up for any account online.

Next, you'll want to download and install the Heroku Toolbelt from https://toolbelt.heroku.com/. Follow the instructions for your specific operating system. Installing the Heroku Toolbelt on your computer will install three things:

1. The Heroku client, a command-line tool for managing Heroku apps. We'll use it to create and manage our Express apps.

2. Foreman, another command-line tool. We'll use it to define how we want our applications to run.

3. Git, the version control system that you likely already have installed.

Once you've installed it, there's one last thing to do: authenticate your computer with Heroku. Open up a command line and type heroku login. This will ask you for your Heroku username and password.

Once you've done all that, Heroku should be set up!
