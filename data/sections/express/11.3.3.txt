Browserify, in its wisdom, has Grunt integration, so we can automate the process of compiling our client-side JavaScript. Browserify...what an amazing piece of technology.

Start by installing grunt-browserify, a Grunt task for Browserify. Install it by running npm install grunt-browserify --save-dev, and then fill in Gruntfile.js with this:

Listing 11.22 A Gruntfile with Browserify

#A Note that we can keep our LESS configuration in here; typical Gruntfiles often have many bits of configuration.

#B Start configuring Browserify...

#C Compile any .js file from my_javascripts into tmp/serve/app.js.

#D Load the grunt-browserify task.

#E When we run “grunt” at the command line, run both Browserify and LESS.

Now, when you run Grunt with npm run grunt, this will compile all of the JavaScript files anywhere in a folder called my_javascripts into tmp/serve/app.js. If you've followed the steps from the LESS guide above, this should already be served!
