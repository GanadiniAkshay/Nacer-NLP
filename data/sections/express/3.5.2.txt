Now we've installed all of our dependencies, create app.js and put the following app inside:

Listing 3.20 The Express guestbook, in app.js

#A First, we require all of the modules we need, just like before.

#B Next, we make an Express app, just like we've done before.

#C Our guestbook app won't have a database; it'll just have an in-memory array. This isn't ideal for a real guestbook, but works for the simple example.

#D Make sure we pass entries to every view.

#E Use Morgan to log every request.

#F The first line tells Express that the views are in a folder called views, and the next line says that the views will use EJS.

#G When visiting the site root, render the homepage (which will be in a views/index.ejs).

#H Render the "new entry" page (at views/index.ejs) when GETting the URL.

#I Define a route handler when we POST to the "new entry" URL.

#J We'll use formBody to parse the data given to us by the "new guestbook entry" form.

#K If there are errors parsing the form body, respond with a 500 error.

#L If the user submits the form with no title or body, respond with a 400 "bad request" error.

#M Add a new entry to the list of entries, with the title, body, and the time published.

#N Finally, redirect back to the homepage to see your new entry.

#O None of the other request handlers happened, so that means we're trying to request an unknown resource. Render a 404 page.Â 

#P Start the server on port 3000!
