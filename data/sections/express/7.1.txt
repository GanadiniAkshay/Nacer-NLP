Before I begin, let me define a term I'll be using a lot: view engine. When I say "view engine", I basically mean "module that does the actual rendering of views".

Jade and EJS are view engines, and there are many others.

American singer-songwriter India.Arie has an excellent song called "Brown Skin". About brown skin she sings "I can't tell where yours begins, I can't tell where mine ends". Similarly, when I first started using Express views, I was confused where Express ended and the view engines began. Luckily, it's not too difficult!

Express is unopinionated about which view engine you use. As long as the view engine exposes an API that Express expects, you're good to go. Express offers a convenience function to help you render your views; let's take a look.
