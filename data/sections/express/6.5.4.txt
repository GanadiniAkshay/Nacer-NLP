There are several status codes in the 300 range, but you'll really only use two of them, and they both involve redirects.

301: "Moved Permanently"

HTTP status code 301 means "don't visit this URL any more; see another URL". 301 responses are accompanied with an HTTP header called Location, so you know where to redirect to.

You've probably been browsing the web and have been redirected in your lifeâ€”this probably happened because of a 301 code.

303: "See Other"

HTTP status code 303 is also a redirect, but it's a little bit different. Just like code 200 is for "regular" requests and 201 is for requests where a resource is created, 301 is for "regular" requests and 303 is for requests where a resource is created and you want to redirect to a new page.
