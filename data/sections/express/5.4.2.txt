It's possible that you'll want to send static files with a route. For example, you might want to send a user's profile picture if they visit /users/123/profile_photo. The static middleware has no way of knowing about this, but Express has a nice way of doing this, which uses a lot of the same internal mechanisms as the static middleware.

Let's say we want to send profile pictures when someone visits /users/:userid/profile_photo. Let's also say that we've earlier populated req.user with the user object (with app.param, as we saw before), and each user object has a property called profilePhotoPath, that holds the local path to the profile photo. Here's how we might do that:

In Chapter 2, we saw that this would be a big headache without Express. We'd have to open the file, figure out its content-type (HTML, plain text, image...), its file size, et cetera. Express's sendfile does all of this for us and lets you send files easily.

You can use this to send any file you want!
